### JavaScript Operators
1. Assignment operators
    > Basic  Assignment operator &emsp;&emsp; a=b <br/>
    > Addition Assignment &emsp;&emsp; a+=b <br/>
    > Subtraction Assignment &emsp;&emsp; a-=b <br/>
    > Multiplication Assignment &emsp;&emsp; a*=b <br/>
    > Division Assignment &emsp;&emsp; a/=b <br/>
    > Remainder Assignment &emsp;&emsp; a%=b <br/>
    > Exponentiation Assignment &emsp;&emsp; a**=b <br/>
    > Left Shift Assignment &emsp;&emsp; a<<=b <br/>
    > Right Shift Assignment &emsp;&emsp; a>>=b <br/>
    > Bitwise AND Assignment &emsp;&emsp; a&=b<br/>
    > Bitwise OR Assignment &emsp;&emsp; a|=b <br/>
    > Bitwise XOR Assignment &emsp;&emsp; a^=b <br/>
    > Logical AND Assignment &emsp;&emsp; a&&=b <br/>
    > Logical OR Assignment &emsp;&emsp; ||=  <br/>
    > Nullish coalescing Assignment &emsp;&emsp; ??= i.e x ?? (x = y) <br/>

2. Comparison operators
    > Equality Operator	&emsp; a == b<br/>
    > Inequality Operator	&emsp; a != b<br/>
    > Strict Equality Operator	&emsp; a === b	<br/>
    > Strict Inequality Operator	&emsp; a !== b	<br/>
    > Greater than Operator	&emsp; a > b	<br/>
    > Greater than or equal Operator	&emsp; a >= b	<br/>
    > Less than Operator	&emsp; a < b	<br/>
    > Less than or equal Operator	&emsp; a <= b <br/>

    ### What should I know about comparing different data types?
    >When comparing different data types, JavaScript may perform type coercion. To avoid unexpected results, use strict comparison operators (===, !==) and ensure the values being compared are of the same type before performing the comparison.

    Type coercion is the automatic conversion of values to a common type during comparison. For example, in 5 == “5”, the string “5” is coerced to the number 5, resulting in true.

    ### What is the difference between == and ===?
    >== compares values with type coercion, meaning it converts both values to a common type before comparing. === compares values without type coercion, ensuring both the value and type must match exactly. similarly, != and !== operators work same way.

3. Arithmetic operators
    > Addition Operator	&emsp; a + b	&emsp; Add two numbers or concatenate the string <br/>
    > Subtraction Operator	&emsp; a – b	&emsp; Difference between the two operators <br/>
    > Multiplication Operator	&emsp; a * b	&emsp; Multiply two numbers <br/>
    > Division Operator	&emsp; a / b	&emsp; Find the quotient of two operands <br/>
    > Modulus Operator	&emsp; a % b	&emsp; Find the remainder of two operands <br/>
    > Exponentiation Operator	&emsp; a ** b	&emsp; Raise the Left operator to the power of the right operator  <br/>
    > Increment Operator	&emsp; a++ and ++a	<br/>
    > Decrement Operator	&emsp; a-- and --a	<br/>
    > Unary Plus(+)	&emsp; +a	&emsp; Converts NaN to number <br/>
    > Unary Negation (-)	&emsp; -a	&emsp; Converts operand to negative. <br/>

    ```js
    let s1 = "12";
    // Using unary plus to convert string to number
    let x = +s1;
    console.log(x);
    // Here we are using typeof operator
    console.log(typeof (x))
    // "Geeks" cannot be converted to a number
    let s2 = +"Geeks";
    console.log(s2);
    ```
    Output:<br/>
    12<br/>
    number<br/>
    NaN<br/>

4. Bitwise operators
    > Bitwise AND(&)	<br/>
    > Bitwise OR(|)		<br/>
    > Biwise XOR(^)		<br/>
    > Bitwise NOT(~)	<br/>
    > Bitwise Left Shift(<<)	<br/>
    > Bitwise Right Shift(>>)	<br/>

5. > Logical operators (&&, ||, ! and Nullish Coalescing Operator(??))
<br/>The nullish coalescing operator (??) returns the right-hand operand when the left-hand operand is either null or undefined. Otherwise, it returns the left-hand operand.

6. BigInt Operators () 
7. String concatenate operator (+)
8. Ternary operator (condition ? trueExpression : falseExpression)
9. Comma operator (,)
10. in and instanceof operators

    The *in*-operator in JavaScript checks if a specified property exists in an object or if an element exists in an array. It returns a Boolean value.

    ```js
    let languages = ["HTML", "CSS", "JavaScript"];
    // true (index 1 exists in the array)
    console.log(1 in languages);
    // false (index 3 doesn't exist in the array)
    console.log(3 in languages); 

    ```

    The *instanceof* operator in JavaScript tests if an object is an instance of a particular class or constructor, returning a Boolean value.
    ```js
    let myString = new String();
    let myDate = new Date();
    console.log(myString instanceof Object);//true
    console.log(myString instanceof Date);//false
    console.log(myString instanceof String);//true
    console.log(myDate instanceof Date);//true
    console.log(myDate instanceof Object);//true
    console.log(myDate instanceof String);//false
    ```

11. typeof Operator
    It returns a string indicating the type, such as “string”, “number”, “boolean”, “object”, etc.
    ```js
    console.log(typeof "Hello");//string
    console.log(typeof 42);//number
    console.log(typeof true);//boolean
    console.log(typeof {});//object
    console.log(typeof undefined);//undefined
    ```
* Can be used anywhere without imports or dependencies.
* Determines the type of literals, variables, and expressions.
* The typeof operator returns “function” when used on functions.
* Special Cases:
    * typeof null returns “object” (a known quirk).
    * Functions return “function” instead of “object”.
* typeof null returns “object”, which is misleading and a legacy bug in JavaScript.
* Cannot distinguish between arrays and objects (typeof [] is “object”).
* Cannot differentiate between classes or specific object types.
* typeof NaN returns “number”, though it’s technically “not a number.”
