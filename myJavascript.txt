Everything in Javascript happens inside an Execution Context


Execution context has two components: 
 1. Memory component(variable environment):  Variables and functions are stored as key-value pairs
 2. Code component(thread of execution): where code is executed one line at a time.

Javascript is a synchronous single-threaded language.
   single-threaded: executes one command at a time
   synchronous: goes to next command only if current command has executed

what is Ajax : Asynchronous jax?
